This project contains the source code for a basic homepage built with HTML and CSS. The `index.html` file serves as the main entry point, showcasing a clean and responsive design. It includes sections such as a header, navigation menu, main content area, and footer. The page is styled using an external CSS file to ensure a consistent and visually appealing layout.

Feel free to customize the `index.html` file to suit your needs or extend it with additional features.
